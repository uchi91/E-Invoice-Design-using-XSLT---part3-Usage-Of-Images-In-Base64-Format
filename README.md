# E-Invoice-Design-using-XSLT---part3-Usage-Of-Images-In-Base64-Format

Two images, now, will be converted into base64 format and placed in their allocated fields.

These areas to be changed can be seen [AreasToPlaceImages.PNG](AreasToPlaceImages.PNG)

* You can convert [companyLogo.PNG](companyLogo.PNG) and [ministryLogo.PNG](ministryLogo.PNG) into base64 format in websites like https://www.base64-image.de/
  * Select one of the PNG file. 
  * Then copy to clipboard the "For use in <img> elements" part as it shows [copyingLogoInRightFormat.PNG](copyingLogoInRightFormat.PNG)
  * If you have trouble for structuring it in correct format, please directly look at the [part3_UsageOfImagesInBase64Format.xslt](part3_UsageOfImagesInBase64Format.xslt) file.

* You can see newly added parts according to previous part between "newly added part is below" and "newly added part is above" comments.

You can find completed file -> [output.html](output.html)
