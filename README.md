# E-Invoice-Design-using-XSLT---part3-Usage-Of-Images-In-Base64-Format

Two images now will be converted into base64 format and placed in their specified sections.
These areas that will change can be seen in AreasToPlaceImages.PNG

If you want to convert logos into base64 on your own, I've uploaded companyLogo.PNG and ministryLogo.PNG.
You can use them in this website https://www.base64-image.de/. Select one of the PNG file. Then copy to clipboard the "For use in <img> elements" part.
guide_copyingLogoInRightFormat.PNG shows how to do it.

If you have trouble for structuring it in correct format, please directly look at the part3_UsageOfImagesInBase64Format.xslt file.
You can see newly added parts between "newly added part is below" and "newly added part is above" comments.

You can see output of the transformation in output.html file.
